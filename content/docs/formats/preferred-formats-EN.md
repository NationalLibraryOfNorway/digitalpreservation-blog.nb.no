This is a list over the preferred file formats for preservation at the National Library of Norway.
The recommendations are prepared by the respective media departments, while the list is managed by the digital preservation team. 

The list covers both files produced by the National Library and files the National Library acquire from external actors.
The preferred formats are those our departments would prefer to have, while the acceptable ones will also be accepted without conversion/normalization. 
Any other formats must be discussed with relevant departments before acceptance.

The list is inspired by [Open Preservation Foundation's (OPF)](https://openpreservation.org) list 
["International Comparison of Recommended File Formats"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XjEjFBCGF3N1spNZc1y0DG8_Uyw18uG2j8V2bsQdYjk/edit#gid=1719869262) 
and the Library of Congress's overviews ["Sustainability of Digital Formats: Planning for Library of Congress Collections"](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/descriptions.shtml) 
and ["Recommended Formats Statement"](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/index.html).
