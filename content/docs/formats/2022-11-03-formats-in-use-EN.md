This list is the result of a collaboration between the NLN and The National Archives of Norway in the autumn of 2020.
The aim was to publish this list on digitalbevaring.no[^1] as a recommendation for the 
  <abbr title="Similar to the english GLAM abbreviation, refers to Archives, Libraries, and Museums in Norway">ABM</abbr> 
community in Norway.
The list corresponds well with a similar list organised by the Open Preservation Foundation. 
This list is designed for cultural and research institutions worldwide.
