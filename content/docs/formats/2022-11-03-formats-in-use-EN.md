This list is the result of a collaboration between the NLN and The National Archives of Norway in the autumn of 2020, where the aim was to publish this list on digitalbevaring.no[^1] as a recommendation for the ABM community in Norway. The list corresponds well with a similar list organised by the Open Preservation Foundation. This list is designed for cultural and research institutions worldwide.
