## Ensure that digital preservation is done in a sustainable way

Digital preservation is a resource-intensive process. 
Be deliberate when selecting what files to preserve, and in what format. 
Choose storage technologies that are environmentally friendly and energy efficient.

## Use well-documented and open file formats wherever possible

This increases the likelihood that we will be able to read and understand and utilize the file now and in the future. 
Good format choices make it easier to manage the file over time. 
Proprietary and undocumented file formats can have a short and unpredictable life spans. 
The NLN recommends the use of the following file formats: [Preferred file formats](/docs/formats "Link to a list of preferred file formats").

## Preserve the original file 

With future format conversions, there is always a risk that the content will be changed in an undesirable way, either deliberately or through errors in the conversion process.
Preserving the original file makes it possible to convert a file again or revert to original. 
In this context the original file refers to the originally handed over file.

## Analyze files that is to be preserved

Generate checksums as early as possible to verify that the file is not modified in handling and retains integrity over time. 
Identify and validate the file type to reveal its current state, and to enable management over time.  

## Maintain sufficient metadata to ensure that the files are identifiable and retrievable

This information should ensure that the files can be managed, understood, used and retrieved in the future, regardless of the external environment.

- **Technical metadata**, such as information about file format, file size, structure, etc. 
  This provides detailed knowledge of the technical composition of the file. 
  It strengthens the integrity of the collection and improves the quality of planned preservation activities, such as format conversion, etc.
- **Administrative metadata**, such as the source of the files, how they were created and processed, rights information, and other provenance. 
  This provides knowledge about the origin and history of the files, and helps to establish the credibility of the content.
- **Descriptive metadata**, such as plot synopsis, content description, information about creators, credits, etc.
  These describe the intellectual content of the files and make the content identifiable and retrievable.

## Use a standardized format to package files for preservation

Standardization enables content and metadata to be exchanged efficiently and in a consistent way, regardless of the type of material or depositor. 
In the NLN, the [eArchiving](https://eark.online/ "Official E-ARK website") [standard](https://dilcis.eu/specifications "Specifications and guidelines for E-ARK and others") is used. 
The use of established standards enables the use of documentation and existing tools.

## Standardise documentation preservation activities

This strengthens the integrity of the collection and improves the quality of planned preservation activities related to format conversion, etc. 
The NLN uses [PREMIS](https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/ "Official PREMIS website") for this.

## Files should be readable and understandable in the present

If it is not possible to open the file in the present, it is unlikely that it will be possible in the future. 
This requires monitoring of file formats and playback platforms in order to take the necessary measures.
Old and outdated file formats are converted to new open formats as needed.

## Ensure that a file is stored in multiple instances, on different storage technologies and in different geographical locations

Multiple instances of a file reduce the likelihood of material being lost due to technical or physical events affecting individual copies.
