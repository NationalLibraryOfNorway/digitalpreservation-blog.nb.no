## Ensure that digital preservation is done in a sustainable way

Be deliberate in selecting which files to preserve and in which format. 
Digital preservation of a file comes with lasting cost implications for the organization. 
Choose storage technologies that are environmentally friendly and energy efficient.

## Use well-documented and open file formats wherever possible

This increases the likelihood that we will be able to read and understand and utilize the file now and in the future.
Good format choices make it easier to manage the file over time.
Proprietary and undocumented file formats can have a short and unpredictable life spans.
The NLN recommends the use of the following file formats: [Preferred file formats](/docs/formats "Link to a list of preferred file formats").

## Preserve the original file

With future format conversions, there is always a risk that the content will be changed in an undesirable way, either deliberately or through errors in the conversion process.
Preserving the original file makes it possible to convert a file again or revert to original.
In this context the original file refers to the originally received file.

## Analyze the file

Generate [checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum "Link to a checksum definition"). as early as possible. 
This enables you to verify whenever needed that the file hasn’t changed. 
Check and document the file’s condition. Confirm the file type and validate that the content is what it claims to be.

## Maintain sufficient metadata to ensure that the files are identifiable and retrievable

This information ensures that files can be managed, understood, used, and retrieved in the future, regardless of external conditions. 
This helps maintain the integrity of the collection

- **Technical metadata**, such as information about file format, file size, structure, etc.
  This provides detailed technical knowledge about the file.
  It strengthens the collection’s integrity and improves the quality of planned preservation activities, such as format conversion etc.
- **Administrative metadata**, such as the source of the files, how they were created and processed, rights information, and other provenance.
  This provides knowledge about the origin and history of the files, and helps to establish the credibility of the content.
- **Descriptive metadata**, such as plot synopsis, content description, information about creators, credits, etc.
  These describe the intellectual content of the files and make the content identifiable and retrievable.

## Use a standard for structuring files

Standardization enables effective exchange of content and metadata in a uniform way, regardless of material type or depositor. 
It also provides access to documentation and support tools. The NLN uses the [eArchiving](https://eark.online/ "Official E-ARK website") [standard](https://dilcis.eu/specifications "Spesifications and guidelines for E-ARK") standard.

## Document preservation activities in a standardized way

This strengthens the collection’s integrity and improves the quality of planned preservation activities. The NLN uses the [PREMIS](https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/ "Official PREMIS website") standard.

## Files must be readable and understandable in the present

f a file cannot be accessed today, it is unlikely it will be accessible in the future. 
This requires monitoring of file formats and playback platforms to implement necessary actions. 
The NLN recommend keeping an eye on ” ["The Global Bit List of Endangered Digital Species"](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/champion-digital-preservation/bit-list "The Global 'Bit List' of Endangered Digital Species").

## Ensure that the file is stored in multiple copies

Multiple copies reduce the risk of data loss due to technical or physical incidents affecting individual files. 
The NLN follows the 3+2+1 principle: 3 file copies, on 2 different storage technologies, with 1 file copy stored at a separate geographic location.
