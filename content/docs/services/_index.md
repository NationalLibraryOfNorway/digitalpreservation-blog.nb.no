The purpose of digital preservation is to ensure that digital materials remain unchanged and accessible - both now and in the future. This requires a solid understanding of the condition of the material. It involves ongoing activities that guarantee the collection's contents are always accessible and usable.

Effective digital preservation relies on several key elements, including active monitoring of the material’s integrity and the use of high-quality metadata. Metadata should describe the material itself, its origin, and any associated rights.

The majority of preserved data in the National Library is either: 
- produced through in-house digitization workflows
- deposited from external producers, but processed and structured through internal workflows

Currently, there are 29 such workflows processing data and sending packages to the DPS for long term digital preservation.
Our internal SIP structuring policy thus needs to function and scale for all existing data workflows.
