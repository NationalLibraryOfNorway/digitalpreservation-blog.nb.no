## Ambition for Digital Preservation

Ensure the protection of, and meaningful access to, national digital cultural heritage for current and future generations.

## Goals for Digital Preservation

- Digital content for digital preservation shall be received using efficient and standardized machine solutions.
- Digital content shall be protected against unintended access, alteration, loss, or damage.
- The National Library shall at all times know what digital content is being preserved, its provenance, its condition, and what has been done to it.
- Digitally preserved content shall be accessible for dissemination now and in the future.

## Challenges

- **Integrity:** It is easy to alter digital content, and it can be challenging to maintain and verify its integrity.
- **Data Size and Volume:** Increasing amounts of data challenge existing solutions for management, storage, and security of the digital collection.
- **Technological Change:** Risk that digital content becomes unusable or incomprehensible when software and hardware become outdated, and the diversity of file formats/variants of formats increases.
- **Professional Competence:** Lack of professional resources can limit the ability to carry out digital preservation.
- **Changes in Usage Patterns:** Unpredictability in terms of who will want access to and retrieve different parts of the preserved content and how it will be used.

## Strategic areas of focus

- **Developing expertise:** Build expertise in digital preservation and have a good knowledge of current practices in the field.
  Actively contribute to national and international initiatives and share experiences.
- **Standardization:** Establish uniform, standardized, and automated handling of digital content and metadata.
- **Technology:** Further develop and ensure robust and scalable technological infrastructure that adheres to the principles[^2] for managing digital content in a secure and sustainable manner.
  This includes both software, hardware, and other infrastructure.
