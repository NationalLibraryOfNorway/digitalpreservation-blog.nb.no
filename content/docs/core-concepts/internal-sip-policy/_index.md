title: Internal SIP policy
weight: 4
---

The majority of preserved data in the National Library is either: 
- produced through in-house digitization workflows
- deposited from external producers, but processed and structured through internal workflows

Currently, there are 29 such workflows processing data and sending packages to the DPS for long term digital preservation.
Our internal SIP structuring policy thus needs to function and scale for all existing data workflows.

This is not an attempt to draw up an ideal system architecture of how it *should* be, but rather an attempt to draw the map as it is (from the point of view of the digital preservation team).
These documents serve as the basis for our ongoing E-ARK standardization work, where we will create different, more specific profiles for various content types.

The following documents describe the current system architecture context we are working within, and, define an intellectual scope of SIPs that function in this context.
