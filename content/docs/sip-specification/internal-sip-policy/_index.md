{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This is the current draft for a SIP policy for **in-house** SIPs.
{{< /callout >}}

The majority of preserved data in the National Library is either: 
- produced through in-house digitization workflows
- deposited from external producers, but processed and structured through internal workflows

Currently there are 29 such workflows processing data and sending packages.
Our internal SIP structuring policy thus needs to function and scale for all existing data workflows.

This is not attempt to draw up an ideal systems architecture of how it *should* be, but rather an attempt draw the map as it is (from the point of view of the digital preservation team).

The following documents describe the current systems architecture context we are working within, and, define Intellectual Entity and SIP scope that functions in this context.
