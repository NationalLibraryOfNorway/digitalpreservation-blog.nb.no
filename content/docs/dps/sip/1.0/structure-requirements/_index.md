title: Requirements for SIP structure
draft: false
weight: 3
---

The package structure in E-ARK follows a standardized organization of folders and files within an information package. The folders are predefined, and each folder has a defined purpose regarding content and file placement. A standardized package and folder structure ensures that preservation materials can be understood, validated, exchanged, and preserved over time, regardless of system or vendor. 

The structural requirements for SIPs in E-ARK are specified in CSIPSTR [(E-ARK (C)SIP specification (v2.2.0))](https://dilcis.eu/specifications/). The National Library has based its requirements on these specifications, but some of the requirements are more narrowly defined and represent stricter variants of the CSIP requirements. 

Any information package submitted to the National Library of Norway is required to fulfill all CSIPSTR requirements as well as all NBSIPSTR requirements.

| [**CSIPSTR1**](https://earkcsip.dilcis.eu/#CSIPSTR1) | Any Information Package **MUST** be included within a single physical root folder (known as the “Information Package root folder”).

See [Events/preservation metadata](/docs/dps/api/submission/events/) for more information. **If** preservation metadata is included in the package, it **MUST** be placed in a subfolder called `preservation`. The E-ARK specifications recommend formatting preservation metadata using PREMIS (see [E-ARK CSIP \| Common Specification for Information Packages](https://earkcsip.dilcis.eu/#useofpremis) and [CS PREMIS](https://dilcis.eu/content-types/cits-premis)). <br> Preservation metadata refers to events and the processing history of the digital resource.

| **NBSIPSTR12** | `root_folder/representations/`<br><br> If needed, the `representations` folder **MAY** contain multiple representations. Naming of representations should consist of a meaningful name and the date the folder was created (*meaningfulname_YYYYMMDD*). A meaningful name typically describes the object’s content or purpose and makes it easier to understand what the object represents (e.g. processed_20251214). Creating multiple representations is only relevant if it is considered necessary to preserve both an original primary representation and something derived from it. This may include an access copy, a processed, normalized, format-migrated, or repaired version of the primary representation. <br><br> The purpose of the derivative, how it was created, and its relationship to the primary representation **SHOULD** be documented in PREMIS events [(CS PREMIS )](https://dilcis.eu/content-types/cits-premis).
