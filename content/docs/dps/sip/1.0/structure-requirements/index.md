CSIPSTR are requirements according to the E-ARK specifications [(E-ARK (C)SIP specification (v2.2.0))](https://dilcis.eu/specifications/). Those marked NBSIPSTR are requirements set by the National Library of Norway. The NBSIPSTR requirements are mainly stricter versions of the CSIP requirements in the E-ARK specifications.

Any information package submitted to the National Library of Norway is required to fulfill all CSIPSTR requirements as well as all NBSIPSTR requirements.
