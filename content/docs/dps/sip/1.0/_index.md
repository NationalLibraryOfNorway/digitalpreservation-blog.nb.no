The [E-ARK standard](https://dilcis.eu/) is a common European specification for structuring, packaging, and transferring digital objects. The standard is based on established frameworks and standards for digital preservation, such as the OAIS standard, PREMIS, and METS. E-ARK defines common requirements for the structure, content, and metadata of information packages (SIP, AIP, and DIP), and facilitates interoperability between system vendors, data producers, and preservation institutions. 

Within E-ARK, the Common Specification for Information Packages (CSIP) is a core specification that defines requirements common to all information packages. In addition to CSIP, there are sub-specifications for packages intended for submission to the preservation environment (SIP), archiving within the preservation environment (AIP), and dissemination from the preservation environment (DIP). 

The applicable specifications for Submission Information Packages (SIP) at the National Library are based on E-ARK and include internal adaptations and clarifications. The documents in this specification define how information packages must be structured and described when delivered to the National Library. 

Here you will find information about: 
- Content of preservation packages (intellectual scope limitations and the concept of representations). 
- Guidance for metadata in preservation packages. 
- General requirements for package structure. 
- The use of METS.xml to describe the package and its contents. 
- Examples for different media types.
