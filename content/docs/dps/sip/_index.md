This section contains the National Library of Norway's specifications for Submission Information Packages (SIPs). The current specifications are based on the [E-ARK standard](https://dilcis.eu/), with internal adaptations and clarifications.

Here you will find information about:
* General requirements for the SIP structure
* Use of METS.xml to describe the package and its contents
* Examples of use for different types of materials

These documents outline the technical requirements for how information packages must be structured and described when delivered to the National Library of Norway.
