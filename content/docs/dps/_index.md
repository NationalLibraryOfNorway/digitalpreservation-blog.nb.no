The Digital Preservation Services (DPS) refers to the National Library's services for digital preservation of cultural heritage resources.
In this specification, a *depositor* is defined as an organization, department, or other entity that utilizes the DPS for the preservation of digital content.

Digital preservation encompasses the reliable preservation of digital information across multiple decades or centuries, despite the potential obsolescence of hardware, software, and file formats. 
The information must remain comprehensible, necessitating active monitoring of information integrity and anticipation of various risks. 
Metadata, which describes the resource, its provenance, and associated rights, plays a fundamental role in the preservation process.

DPS ensures the preservation of important national resources housed within libraries, archives, and museums. 
Digital cultural heritage resources encompass both digitized and born-digital resources: publications subject to legal deposit legislation, government publications constituting national cultural heritage, and other digital resources worthy of preservation created by organizations under the Ministry of Culture and Equality.
