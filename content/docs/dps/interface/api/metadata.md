title: Metadata Requirements

In addition to requiring a metadata file within the Submission Information Packages (SIPs), the National Library of Norway also requires a set of metadata submitted via the submission API. This ensures that a minimum level of metadata associated with the submitted representations is indexed and made searchable.

Our metadata requirements are based on Dublin Core, an international ISO standard widely used in archives, libraries, and digital collections. We chose Dublin Core because it is relatively easy to understand, simple to implement, and both flexible and extensible. To make the metadata more structured, we have supplemented the standard with attributes in addition to the elements.

Most metadata elements are optional, but we strongly encourage contributors to provide as complete metadata as possible. This enhances searchability and improves the long-term understanding and usability of the resources.

To make the deposited packages as self-contained as possible from a preservation perspective â€”and to ensure control over file formats, we also include the metadata in an XML file attached to the Archival Information Package (AIP). XML is well-suited for long-term preservation: it is an open format, widely used, and a well-established standard for metadata exchange. Its text-based structure makes it readable by both machines and humans, which is a significant advantage for preservation purposes.

**General Guidelines for the Use of Standards**<br>
Punctuation and character encoding for field input should follow [UTF-8](https://snl.no/UTF-8).<br>
[ISO 639-2](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:639:-2:ed-1:v1:en) is used as the standard for specifying language when the lang attribute is applied.<br>
[ISO 8601-2](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:8601:-2:ed-1:v1:en) is used as the standard format for specifying dates and times.<br>
[ISO 3166-2](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:3166:-1:ed-4:v1:en) is used to specify country codes.
