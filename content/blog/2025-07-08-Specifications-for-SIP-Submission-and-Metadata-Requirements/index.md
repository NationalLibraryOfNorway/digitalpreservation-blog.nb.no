As part of the [pilot project](/blog/2025-01-28-lam-longterm-preservation-pilot/) on long-term preservation of museums’ digital cultural heritage, the team has been working on defining a standardized approach for the transfer of digital objects to the National Library of Norway. The work is based on the [E-ARK specification](https://dilcis.eu/), from which it is defined more specific requirements for the delivery of information packages.

In addition, the team have focused on how to ensure that a minimum set of descriptive metadata is submitted alongside the digital objects. The primary purpose of this is to enable basic search and identification within the preservation environment, and it is not intended as a substitute for richer metadata delivered within the package itself. The approach is based on the [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) metadata standard, which is a basic standard, features open fields (no controlled vocabularies), and can be used for a variety of media types.

Documentation for SIP submission is available here: [SIP 1.0](/docs/dps/sip/1.0/).

Documentation on metadata submission requirements is available here: [Metadata Requirements](/docs/dps/api/submission/metadata/).


Initially, the published documentation is intended for use within the scope of the pilot project. It primarily focuses on the submission of still image material. However, the intention is to use the same specifications for internal deposit workflows at the National Library as well. Further updates and modifications to the documentation will be introduced as we proceed beyond the pilot.
