This is an overview of the digital formats preferred for digital preservation at the National Library. 

The Digital Preservation Team has compiled a list of file formats which is preferred by the National Library for digital preservation. The format list is based on recommendations from the respective media departments within the National Library. 

The list includes both formats produced by the National Library itself and formats received from others.  

The preferred formats is a list of formats we ideally want and are striving for. The acceptable formats will also be accepted and taken care of without conversion or normalization. 

All other formats should be discussed with the relevant media departments within the National Library before they are accepted and included in the management system. 

The list is published in both Norwegian and English and can be found here: 

The Preferred file formats list is available [here](/docs/formats/preferred-formats-en/ "Link to our Preferred file formats list").

The Digital Preservation Team plans to conduct annual reviews of the list.
