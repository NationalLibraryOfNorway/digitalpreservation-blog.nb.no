We were invited to talk at the [Digital libraries: storage for now and forever](https://www.bn.org.pl/aktualnosci/5307-digital-libraries:-storage-for-now-and-forever.-konferencja-na-temat-przechowywania-zbiorow-w-bibliotekach-cyfrowych..html) conference hosted by the IFLA Preservation and Conservation Center at the National Library of Poland. The presentation is a crash course through digital storage and digital preservation practices at the National Library of Norway over the past 20 years. It concludes with our current status and our future plans.
