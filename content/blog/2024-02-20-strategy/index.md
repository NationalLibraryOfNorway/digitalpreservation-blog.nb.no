The Digital Preservation Team at the National Library (NLN) has developed its inaugural strategy for digital preservation. This strategy aims to steer, structure, and sharpen our focus on digital preservation initiatives over the coming two years.

## Strategy Design

In crafting this strategy, we prioritized brevity and clarity, while trying to avoid overwhelming potential readers with dense text or producing a document that gets tucked away and forgotten. The strategy is designed to illuminate key decisions in our digital preservation journey as they arise.

Our design process was iterative, guided by a methodology that involved extensive review cycles. Over a span of slightly more than two months, a dedicated working group composed of team and departmental members met weekly. Each meeting began with a fresh review of the document’s text and structure, intentionally allowing time between sessions for reflection and idea maturation.

Initial meetings saw significant changes to the document’s structure, but we gradually achieved a stable framework, shifting our focus to refining the wording and content. It was also vital that the strategy remained flexible, avoiding constraints on the NLN’s relationships with external partners and financial considerations. The result is a concise, one-page document that we believe offers valuable guidance for NLN’s digital preservation efforts.

This strategy has been reviewed and ratified by the organization, initially by the team's board of owners and subsequently by the NLN board of directors.

## Structure of the Strategy Document

The document is divided into five main sections:

- We begin with the rationale for digital preservation at the NLN, grounded in the mandates of Norwegian law.
- Next, we outline the NLN’s vision for digital preservation, introducing the concept of national digital cultural heritage as the scope of our preservation efforts. The scope extends beyond legally deposited materials, and also includes materials from other cultural institutions.
- We then delineate four specific goals. The goals aim at effective collection, secure storage, active management of the digital collection, and ensuring current and future access to these materials. Acknowledging that immediate accessibility is a precursor to long-term preservation.
- The document also sheds light on some major challenges facing the NLN when it comes to digital preservation, acknowledging the evolving nature of these obstacles.
- Lastly, we specify three strategic priorities: enhancing knowledge of digital preservation in the organization, adhering to established standards, and employing tools and technology responsibly and sustainably. These are underpinned by the [current principles](/docs/principles/) of digital preservation at the NLN.

## Operationalization of the Strategy in the Team

To make practical use of this strategy, the team has devised a comprehensive roadmap outlining key digital preservation initiatives for the next two years. This roadmap ties all activities back to our three strategic priorities.

Activities are prioritized and detailed at the monthly meeting with the board of owners, subsequently organized into “Epics” within Atlassian Jira.

For each “Epic,” we outline specific Jira tasks, clarifying objectives and approaches, especially for tasks with unclear methodologies. This creates a cohesive thread from the overarching strategy document down to the granular tasks undertaken by the Digital Preservation Team.

This structured approach has proven effective. It has set a clear direction for NLN’s digital preservation work, constantly reminding the team of our strategic goals through daily tasks and activities.
