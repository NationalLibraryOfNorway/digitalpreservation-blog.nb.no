### **Why digital preservation at the National Library of Norway?**

The National Library of Norway’s mandate is to collect, preserve, and make accessible all published content across all types of media. This means that everything published in Norway, or published abroad about Norway, must be preserved and made available both now and in the future - whether it is physical or born-digital content. “All types of media” include, among other things, books, journals, e-books, audiobooks, posters, cards, advertisements, theatre programs, all Norwegian websites, radio broadcasts, and television programs - the list is extensive ! For this reason, the National Library is considered the most important source of knowledge about Norway and Norwegian society.
The library’s societal mission is to give the people of Norway access to our shared knowledge and cultural history. This is achieved by preserving, digitizing, and disseminating everything published for the public. Access to our cultural heritage is essential for democracy and public enlightenment, and provides a foundation for identity and historical understanding.
